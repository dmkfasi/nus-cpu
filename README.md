# nus-cpu

This is my yet another attempt to re-create Nintendo 64 mother board for a portable mod.

I am going after completely modular design and the best visual display picture.

There are many bright minds out there whose idea I try to adopt and develop further, But since I lack of expertise on some electronic topics, this whole thing definately will need some tune up.
Feel free to use, share and modify!
