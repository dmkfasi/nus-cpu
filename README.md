# nus-cpu

This is my own yet another attempt to re-create Nintendo 64 motherboard for a portable, tablet or bartop mod.

I am going after for as much as possible: modular design, reuse of original components, cheapest production costs and the best visual display picture.

There are many bright minds out there whose ideas I try to adopt and develop further. But since I lack of expertise on several electronics topics, this whole thing definately will need some tune up.

Feel free to use, share and modify!
